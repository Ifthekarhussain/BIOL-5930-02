This folder contains the original RNA-Seq dataset used for the lung cancer differential expression analysis project.

Dataset Information:
- Source: NCBI GEO Database
- Accession Number: GSE81089
- Description: Includes RNA-Seq data from 218 human lung tissue samples, with 199 tumor and 19 normal tissue samples.
- Data Type: Raw read counts generated by featureCounts.

The dataset was downloaded in text format and used directly for downstream processing in R. No alterations were made to the original file content. All analysis was conducted using this raw count matrix as the starting point.

This folder serves as the foundation for all subsequent steps in the analysis pipeline, including filtering, normalization, and differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2.
