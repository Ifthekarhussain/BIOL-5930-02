This folder contains R scripts used in the RNA-Seq differential expression project.

- `data_cleaning.R`: Performs preprocessing on the raw count matrix. Filters low-count genes, matches metadata, and prepares data for DESeq2.
- Additional scripts (e.g., analysis or plotting) can also be added here for modularity.

Scripts are written to ensure reproducibility and follow a structured, commented format for clarity.
