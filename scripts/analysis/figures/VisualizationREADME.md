# Figures â€” Visualization Outputs for RNA-Seq Analysis

This folder contains visualizations created from the differential gene expression analysis of lung tumor vs. normal tissue samples.

## Included Plots

- **PCA Plot**: Shows sample clustering and separation between tumor and normal groups based on overall gene expression.
- **Volcano Plot**: Highlights genes with statistically significant and biologically meaningful expression changes.
- **MA Plot**: Displays mean gene expression versus fold change, colored by significance.
- **Heatmap**: Depicts expression patterns of the top 30 differentially expressed genes across all samples.
- **Top Genes Barplot**: Shows the most highly upregulated and downregulated genes with their respective fold changes.
- **P-value Histogram**: Illustrates the distribution of adjusted p-values across all tested genes.
- **Fold Change Density Plot**: Provides a visual overview of how expression changes are distributed.

## Purpose

These figures provide intuitive insights into gene-level differences and validate the results of the statistical analysis. They also help communicate complex findings clearly in reports and presentations.
